Tryneboka Session Capture
=========================

Simple utility to capture a HTTP Get `cookie` parameter and dump the output to console (stdout).
Made as a personal test, not a production ready product of high quality.

Works like a HTTP server, may be used to capture hijacked session and authentication tokens.

Written in C# using dotnet 8.

```
dotnet run
